# Booking Flow Test Plan

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Stripe test keys configured
- Test database/Supabase environment
- Test user accounts created
- Test payment methods configured

### Test Data
```typescript
interface TestData {
  validUser: {
    email: string;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    mobile: string;
  };
  validAddress: {
    blockStreet: string;
    floorUnit: string;
    postalCode: string;
    condoName?: string;
    lobbyTower?: string;
  };
  validCards: {
    success: string;
    insufficient: string;
    declined: string;
  };
}

const TEST_DATA: TestData = {
  validUser: {
    email: "test@example.com",
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    mobile: "91234567"
  },
  validAddress: {
    blockStreet: "123 Test Street",
    floorUnit: "#01-01",
    postalCode: "123456",
    condoName: "Test Condo"
  },
  validCards: {
    success: "4242424242424242",
    insufficient: "4000000000009995",
    declined: "4000000000000002"
  }
};
```

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Happy Path Tests

#### 1.1 Complete Booking Flow
1. Select service
2. Enter customer information
3. Select date and time
4. Review booking
5. Complete payment
6. View confirmation

**Expected Result**: Booking created successfully with correct status and payment processed

#### 1.2 Return Customer Flow
1. Login as existing customer
2. Verify pre-filled information
3. Complete booking process
4. Check booking history

**Expected Result**: Previous customer information loaded and new booking added to history

### 2. Error Cases

#### 2.1 Payment Failures
1. Test insufficient funds
2. Test declined card
3. Test expired card
4. Test invalid CVC

**Expected Result**: Appropriate error messages shown and booking not confirmed

#### 2.2 Validation Errors
1. Test invalid email format
2. Test invalid phone number
3. Test missing required fields
4. Test invalid postal code

**Expected Result**: Form validation errors displayed and submission prevented

#### 2.3 Session Timeout
1. Start booking process
2. Wait for warning (15 minutes)
3. Wait for timeout (20 minutes)
4. Attempt to continue

**Expected Result**: Warning shown and session expired with redirect

### 3. Edge Cases

#### 3.1 Browser Navigation
1. Test back button during flow
2. Test refresh during flow
3. Test closing tab/window
4. Test multiple tabs

**Expected Result**: State preserved or appropriate warnings shown

#### 3.2 Network Issues
1. Test slow connection
2. Test connection loss during payment
3. Test connection loss during booking creation
4. Test retry mechanisms

**Expected Result**: Appropriate error handling and recovery options

#### 3.3 Concurrent Bookings
1. Test same time slot booking
2. Test multiple bookings by same user
3. Test booking conflicts

**Expected Result**: Proper handling of race conditions and conflicts
