# Card Routing Documentation

## Issue 1: Incorrect Navigation Path
- **Problem**: The Gas Check & Leakage Issues card was routing to '/booking/confirmation'
- **Impact**: Users were being directed to the wrong page
- **Solution**: Updated the navigation path in ServiceCategorySelection.tsx to '/booking/gas-check-leakage'

## Issue 2: Path Mismatch
- **Problem**: The navigation path in ServiceCategorySelection.tsx ('/booking/gas-check-leakage') didn't match the route defined in router.tsx ('/booking/gas-check-leak')
- **Impact**: Navigation failed silently as the route didn't exist
- **Solution**: Aligned the navigation path in ServiceCategorySelection.tsx with the router configuration by changing it to '/booking/gas-check-leak'

## Best Practices
1. Always verify that navigation paths match the routes defined in the router configuration
2. Use route constants from ROUTES configuration when available
3. Test navigation flows thoroughly after making changes
4. Add logging to help debug navigation issues
5. Keep routing documentation up to date
