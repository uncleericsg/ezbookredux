## Learnings from PaymentStep.tsx Refactoring

1. **Type Safety First Approach**
   - Start with proper type definitions before making structural changes
   - Use type guards to ensure API response safety
   - Define clear interfaces for state management
   - Leverage TypeScript to catch potential issues early

2. **Error Boundary Hierarchy**
   - Root error boundary in main.tsx handles application-wide errors
   - Remove nested error boundaries to prevent context issues
   - Proper provider ordering is crucial (Redux -> QueryClient -> Router)
   - Component-specific error states can coexist with root boundary

3. **State Management Improvements**
   - Separate loading states from error states
   - Use isLoading flag instead of status enum for loading states
   - Clear separation between payment states and UI states
   - Type-safe state transitions

4. **Code Organization Benefits**
   - Grouped related types and interfaces
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Improved code readability
   - Better maintainability

5. **Testing Implications**
   - Need to test error boundary with React Query
   - Verify error propagation through provider hierarchy
   - Test loading and error states independently
   - Ensure proper error recovery flows

These learnings will guide our approach to refactoring the remaining components, particularly PriceSelectionPage.tsx and ServiceScheduling.tsx.

## Updated Next Steps

1. Review this additional information with the development team
2. Incorporate these insights into our codebase analysis and component review process
3. Pay special attention to the PaymentStep and PriceSelectionPage components during our analysis
4. Ensure our consolidated ErrorBoundary solution addresses all identified error handling patterns and requirements
5. Update our testing strategy to cover all identified error scenarios
6. Proceed with the Information Gathering and Analysis phase as planned

By incorporating these insights from the Phase1-QueryClient.md document, we can ensure a more thorough and effective Error Boundary Consolidation process.
