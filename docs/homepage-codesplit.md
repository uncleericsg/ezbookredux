# Homepage Code Splitting Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for code splitting the homepage (ServiceCategorySelection) component. For detailed implementation analysis, see [homepage-codesplit-analysis.md](./homepage-codesplit-analysis.md).

## Strategy

### 1. Directory Structure
```
src/
  components/
    home/
      layout/        # Layout components
      features/      # Feature components
      sections/      # Section components
      hooks/         # Custom hooks
      utils/         # Utility functions
```

### 2. Component Breakdown
1. Layout Components:
```
home/layout/
- HomeLayout.tsx      # Main layout wrapper
- HomeHeader.tsx      # Header section
- HomeContainer.tsx   # Content container
```

2. Feature Components:
```
home/features/
- CategoryCard.tsx    # Service category card
- TestimonialCard.tsx # Testimonial display
- RatingModal.tsx     # Rating interface
- PopularTag.tsx      # Popular service tag
```

3. Section Components:
```
home/sections/
- WelcomeSection.tsx       # Welcome header
- CategoryGrid.tsx         # Service categories
- TestimonialsSection.tsx  # Testimonials
- TrustIndicatorsSection.tsx # Trust indicators
```

### 3. Implementation Timeline

#### Week 1: Setup & Structure
- [ ] Create directory structure
- [ ] Set up base components
- [ ] Implement core layouts

#### Week 2: Component Migration
- [ ] Migrate existing components
- [ ] Implement lazy loading
- [ ] Set up state management

#### Week 3: Optimization & Testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Testing implementation
- [ ] Documentation updates

#### Week 4: Review & Release
- [ ] Code review
- [ ] Performance validation
- [ ] Gradual rollout

### 4. Success Metrics

1. Performance
- [ ] 20% reduction in initial bundle size
- [ ] <3s First Contentful Paint
- [ ] <4s Time to Interactive

2. Code Quality
- [ ] Reduced component complexity
- [ ] Improved test coverage
- [ ] Better maintainability

3. User Experience
- [ ] Smooth loading transitions
- [ ] Consistent animation performance
- [ ] Improved mobile experience

### 5. Rollback Plan

1. Immediate Rollback Triggers
- Performance degradation >20%
- Critical user path disruption
- Mobile experience issues

2. Rollback Process
- Revert to main branch
- Restore original component
- Analyze failure points

3. Recovery Steps
- Identify issue source
- Implement fixes
- Gradual re-implementation

### 6. Future Considerations

1. Scalability
- Component reusability
- State management patterns
- Performance monitoring

2. Maintenance
- Documentation updates
- Performance benchmarks
- Testing strategy

3. Feature Addition
- Component extension points
- State management scaling
- Animation system flexibility

## Conclusion
This strategy provides a structured approach to code splitting while maintaining functionality and user experience. The phased implementation ensures careful validation at each step.
