   - [ ] Implement stricter type constraints
   - [ ] Add type assertions in critical paths

3. Documentation
   - [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all type definitions
   - [ ] Create type usage guidelines
   - [ ] Document common patterns and best practices
   - [ ] Add examples for component type usage

4. Testing Infrastructure
   - [ ] Add type testing to CI pipeline
   - [ ] Create type validation utilities
   - [ ] Add test coverage requirements
   - [ ] Implement automated type checks

## Implementation Details

### 1. Type System Foundation
- Created base interfaces for component props
- Implemented type guards for runtime validation
- Added utility types for common patterns
- Created mock data for testing

### 2. Type Guards
- Added comprehensive type guards for:
  - Settings validation
  - Component props
  - Runtime type checking
  - Data validation

### 3. Testing Infrastructure
- Added unit tests for type guards
- Created mock data utilities
- Implemented test helpers
- Added type assertion utilities

### 4. Admin Components
- Implemented proper typing for:
  - AdminBookings
  - AdminHeader
  - AdminNav
- Added runtime validation
- Improved error handling
- Added loading states

## Best Practices

### Type Safety
1. Always use type guards for runtime validation
2. Implement proper error handling with types
3. Use assertion functions for critical paths
4. Add comprehensive tests for type logic

### Component Types
1. Extend base interfaces when possible
2. Use type guards in component logic
3. Add proper error boundaries
4. Document type requirements

### Testing
1. Use mock data for type testing
2. Test edge cases and error conditions
3. Validate type guard behavior
4. Test component type safety
