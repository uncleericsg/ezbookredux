- [x] Update TypeScript configuration
- [x] Create initial roadmap
- [x] Split payment and receipt services
- [x] Implement webhook handling
- [x] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [x] Document services and utilities

- [ ] Configure rollback procedures

## Blockers & Dependencies
- Frontend team availability for integration testing
- Vercel configuration access
- Monitoring service API keys

## Resource Allocation
- 2 developers for frontend integration (3 days)
- 1 QA engineer for testing implementation (4 days)
- 1 DevOps engineer for deployment setup (2 days)

## Timeline
- Frontend Integration: 3 days (High Priority)
- Testing Implementation: 4 days (High Priority)
- Deployment Strategy: 2 days (High Priority)
- Monitoring Setup: 1 day (Medium Priority)
- Documentation Updates: Completed âœ…

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Frontend Integration**
   - Begin updating frontend components with new import paths
   - Create integration examples for frontend team
   - Schedule integration testing session

2. **Testing Setup**
   - Set up testing framework (Jest/Vitest)
   - Create first batch of unit tests for payment service
   - Set up test database for integration tests

3. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Gather required environment variables
   - Document deployment requirements
   - Create deployment checklist

Total Estimated Time: 9 days (reduced from 11 days due to completed documentation)
