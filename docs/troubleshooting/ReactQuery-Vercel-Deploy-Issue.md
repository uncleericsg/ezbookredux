# React Query Vercel Deployment Issue Analysis

## Issue Description
- Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'createContext')" at QueryClientProvider.js:6:45
- App not rendering on Vercel deployment
- Local development works fine

## Current vs Working Configuration Analysis

### 1. Provider Changes (main.tsx)
| Component | Working Version (518a006) | Current Version | Impact |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------|---------|
| PersistGate | Not present | Present | ‚úÖ Positive: Solved logout issues on refresh |
| ErrorBoundary | Basic ErrorBoundary | EnhancedErrorBoundary | üîç Investigation needed |
| Provider Order | ErrorBoundary -> Provider -> QueryClientProvider | Different nesting | üîç Investigation needed |
| QueryClient Config | Basic config | Added refetchOnWindowFocus | üîç Potential issue |
| Toaster | Not present | Present | ‚úÖ Safe: UI-only component |

### 2. Vite Configuration Changes
| Feature | Working Version (518a006) | Current Version | Impact |
|---------|-------------------------|-----------------|---------|
| manualChunks | Simple (jszip only) | Complex chunking | üîç Investigation needed |
| optimizeDeps | exclude: ['lucide-react'] | Different config | üîç Investigation needed |
| build target | es2020 | esnext | üîç Investigation needed |

## Systematic Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Query Client Configuration
1. Test removing refetchOnWindowFocus
2. Verify QueryClient initialization timing
3. Check for any race conditions in context creation

### Phase 2: Provider Order Analysis
1. Document current provider dependencies
2. Analyze initialization order requirements
3. Test different provider arrangements while maintaining PersistGate functionality

### Phase 3: Build Configuration
1. Test with simplified chunks
2. Verify React Query bundling
3. Check for any version conflicts

### Phase 4: Error Boundary Impact
1. Compare error handling between versions
2. Check for any context initialization interference
3. Test with both implementations

## Fix Attempts Log

### Attempt 1: Vite Config Modification
- Changed build configuration
- Added commonjs options
- Result: Issue persists

### Attempt 2: Provider Restructuring
- Modified provider order
- Added error handling
- Result: Issue persists

## Next Steps
1. Start with Phase 1 investigation
2. Document each change and its impact
3. Test changes in isolation
4. Maintain working features (PersistGate, etc.)
5. Verify each fix in both development and production

## Important Notes
- Keep PersistGate as it solves logout issues
- Maintain enhanced error handling if possible
- Focus on React Query initialization timing
- Consider production vs development differences
