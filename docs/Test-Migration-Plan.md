# Test Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for migrating and improving test organization, execution, and reporting in the iAircon EasyBooking project.

## Current Status (Updated: 2024-01-26)
‚úÖ Migration Progress:
- Directory structure created and verified
- Frontend test utilities implemented (renderWithProviders)
- Backend/integration test utilities partially implemented
- Report generators fully implemented and TypeScript migrated
- Test coverage, performance, and status reporting complete

### Migration Statistics
| Category | Total Tests | Migrated | Pending | Status |
|----------|-------------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Components | 21 | 4 | 17 | üü° In Progress |
| Store/Types | 4 | 2 | 2 | üü° In Progress |
| Services/Adapters | 25 | 3 | 22 | üü° In Progress |
| Others | 35 | 0 | 35 | üî¥ Not Started |
| **Total** | **85** | **9** | **76** | üü° **11%** |

### Next Steps
1. Set up test coverage reporting:
   - Configure Vitest coverage options
   - Set up coverage thresholds
   - Generate HTML reports
2. Begin implementing report generators:
   - Coverage analysis
   - Performance metrics
   - Status tracking

### Configuration Cleanup Tasks
- [ ] Remove jest.setup.ts (Pending verification)
- [x] Verify Vitest configuration (Complete with coverage, paths, and reporters)
- [x] Add path aliases to tsconfig.json (Configured in tsconfig.test.json)
- [x] Update import paths for test utilities (Set up in tests/setup)

Configuration Status:
- Vitest: Fully configured with coverage settings and reporters
- Path Aliases: Implemented in both vitest.config.ts and tsconfig.test.json
- Test Utilities: Organized in tests/setup with proper mocking support
- Migration: Jest to Vitest transition in progress
