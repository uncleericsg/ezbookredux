# Redux Migration Execution Plan

> **Important**: This migration ONLY changes state management (Context â†’ Redux).
> It will NOT affect any:
> - UI layouts or designs
> - Visual components or styles
> - CSS or design system
> - User experience or interactions
> - Existing features or functionality

## 1. Project Setup

### Copy Project
```
From: project/
To:   project-redux/

Skip these files:
- src/contexts/* (All context files)
```

### Install Redux
```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

## 2. Files to Rebuild

### Context Files (Remove)
```
src/contexts/
  - AuthContext.tsx
  - UserContext.tsx
  - AdminViewContext.tsx
```

### Components (Rebuild with Redux)
```
src/components/
  auth/
    - LoginForm.tsx     # Login/logout (same UI, new state)
    - ProtectedRoute.tsx # Auth check (same routing, new state)
  
  user/
    - UserProfile.tsx   # Profile management (same UI, new state)
    - BookingForm.tsx   # Create bookings (same form, new state)
    - BookingList.tsx   # View bookings (same list, new state)
  
  admin/
    - AdminDashboard.tsx # Admin views (same layout, new state)
```

## 3. New Redux Structure

### Store Setup
```
src/store/
  - index.ts         # Redux store
  - authSlice.ts     # Auth state
  - userSlice.ts     # User state
  - adminSlice.ts    # Admin state
```

## 4. Migration Steps

1. **Copy Project & Setup**
   - Copy project excluding context files
   - Install Redux packages
   - Create store files

2. **Create Redux Store**
   - Set up store with slices
   - Add basic error handling
   - Keep it simple, only what we need

3. **Rebuild Components**
   - Start with auth (login/logout)
   - Then user features
   - Finally admin features
   - Preserve all UI/visuals during updates

## 5. Testing Checklist

Basic Features (All with existing UI preserved):
- [ ] Login works (same form, new state)
- [ ] User profile loads (same layout, new state)
- [ ] Can create bookings (same form, new state)
- [ ] Admin features work (same dashboard, new state)

## 6. UI Preservation Checklist

Verify these remain unchanged:
- [ ] All component layouts
- [ ] All styles and CSS
- [ ] All visual interactions
- [ ] All UI components
- [ ] All user flows
- [ ] All responsive behaviors

That's it! Keep it focused on what we actually need.
