  Auto-Analysis Refactor Prompt

  Purpose:
  This XML file serves as a template for requesting an AI-powered analysis and generation of a comprehensive refactoring plan. It's designed to streamline the process of creating detailed implementation plans for various software development issues or refactoring tasks.

  How to Use:
  1. Fill in the <issue-description> section with a brief overview of the problem you're facing.
  2. Provide relevant details about your project in the <project-context> section, including tech stack, architecture, or specific components involved.
  3. Present this filled-out XML to an AI assistant with the following instruction:
     "Using the provided XML prompt, analyze the issue and project context, then automatically generate a comprehensive implementation plan by filling in all the sections in the <output-requirements>."

  Expected Output:
  The AI will analyze the provided information and automatically fill in:
  - A suitable task name
  - Current state analysis
  - Objectives for the refactoring
  - A detailed implementation plan with phases for analysis, design, implementation, testing, and documentation
  - Potential risks and mitigation strategies
  - Success criteria for the refactoring task

  Benefits:
  - Quickly obtain structured, detailed plans for various refactoring or issue-resolution tasks
  - Minimal input required from the user
  - Leverages AI's ability to analyze the situation and propose appropriate solutions
  - Ensures a thorough, context-aware plan for your specific issue

  Note: The quality and relevance of the generated plan depend on the detail and clarity of the information provided in the issue description and project context sections.
