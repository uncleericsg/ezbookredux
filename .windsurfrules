Always read the .cascade-config.json file first and ensure all changes follow the project conventions.

Always follow the .cascade-config.json from: c:\Users\djxpi\OneDrive\Documents\2024_iAircon_EasyBooking_WINDSURF\CascadeProjects\windsurf-project\project

Do not damage any of the UI features and components while working at all times

always read the @ai protection policy on page if available and do not break any visual, remove any current UI features or create any new ones without consent.

All Component files, always verify:
1. Types/interfaces are exported at the top
2. Component is declared as a const
3. displayName is added
4. Both named and default exports are included at the bottom
5. All files align with .cascade-config.json requirements

Do not edit the eslint.config.js file without my consent.

Before any major changes like UI library migrations, must provide a checklist.

Before proceeding with any major changes, please:
1. List all files that will be affected
2. Provide a detailed and systematic plan
3. Explain how you'll maintain consistency across the codebase

Systematic Changes Request When requesting changes that affect multiple files:
Please make changes systematically:
1. First show all files that need changes
2. Explain the pattern you'll apply
3. Make changes in small, verifiable batches
4. Verify each batch before proceeding

Framework Verification Before implementing features:
Please verify:
1. What routing library we're using
2. What UI components we're using
3. What state management we're using
4. Show me the relevant imports before making changes

Consistency Check After making changes:
Please verify:
1. All exports follow our project convention
2. All imports match their corresponding exports
3. No framework-specific code is mixed (e.g., Next.js with React Router)
4. All component patterns are consistent

Change Scope When making changes:
Please:
1. List all files you plan to modify
2. Explain why each file needs changes
3. Show the pattern you'll apply
4. Make changes in small batches
5. Test each batch before proceeding

ALWAYS CLARIFIY BEFORE EXECUTING ANY FILE CHANGES:
Seek for clarifications before executing any file, UI and visual changes or adding new features, never overwrite and change any UI or visuals without my permission.
